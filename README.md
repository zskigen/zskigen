## Current Projects

- **Senior Thesis (2025‚Äì26): Bayesian Joint Modeling of Pain and Depression**  
  - Developing a hierarchical Bayesian framework to jointly model **chronic pain and depression outcomes** in transgender healthcare.  
  - Comparing **empirical Bayes vs. full Bayes approaches**, with EB+ correction.  
  - Running simulation studies on **posterior contraction for small subgroups** and building **decision-focused MCID calibration curves**.  

- **Data Science Capstone (2025‚Äì26): Cloud-Based Baseball Analytics Infrastructure**  
  - Designing a **cloud-based architecture** to ingest and persist tracking API data using PostgreSQL and Python ETL pipelines.  
  - Building automated statistical reporting workflows (Python, SQL, CI) to deliver reproducible summaries of pitch-level data.  
  - Prototyping a **Streamlit app** for interactive data visualization and model exploration.

## üß™ Past Projects

- **Quantitative Analyst Associate, Philadelphia Phillies (Summer 2025)**  
  - Directed independent research on the **Automated Ball-Strike Challenge System (AAA level)**.  
  - Built SQL + Python pipelines (BigQuery, nested CTEs, window functions) to compute **per-pitch challenge run values** and estimate opportunity cost ($L$).  

- **Biomechanical Drivers of Pitch Velocity (2024)**  
  - Analyzed **Driveline OpenBiomechanics** and TrackMan datasets to identify biomechanical predictors of velocity.  
  - Built nonlinear models (XGBoost) with tuned CV, achieving **~2‚Äì3 mph prediction error**.  
  - Applied feature importance analysis to study **energy transfer through the pitching kinetic chain**.  

- **Pomona-Pitzer Baseball Analytics (2023‚Äìpresent)**  
  - Co-Director of Analytics & Data Engineering.  
  - Developed **Stuff+/Pitching+/Location+ models**, opponent scouting pipelines, and automated workflows to support NCAA DIII decision-making.
